# Blokchaiin-work-

A basic blockchain implementation in Python, demonstrating core concepts such as blocks, proof-of-work, digital signatures, and transactions with simple wallet functionality. This project is intended for educational purposes and experimentation with blockchain technology.

## Features

- **Block Structure:** Each block contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, a hash, and a reference to the previous block hash.
- **Proof-of-Work:** Simple mining mechanism to secure the blockchain.
- **Transactions:** Includes digital signatures (using ECDSA) for transaction authenticity and integrity.
- **Wallets:** Generate public/private key pairs for sending and receiving funds.
- **Mining Rewards:** Miners receive coins for mining new blocks.
- **Validation:** Full chain and transaction validation for security.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [ecdsa](https://pypi.org/project/ecdsa/) library

Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install ecdsa
```

### Running the Blockchain

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dingoroma/Blokchaiin-work-.git
cd Blokchaiin-work-
```

Run the main script:
```bash
python wallet_blockchain.py
```

### Example Output

- Generates wallets for Alice and Bob.
- Alice signs and sends a transaction to Bob.
- The block is mined.
- The blockchain is validated and printed.

## File Overview

- `wallet_blockchain.py`: Main blockchain logic with blocks, transaction signatures, mining, and validation.
- `simple_blockchain.py`: (If present) A minimal, introductory blockchain example for learning.

## How It Works

1. **Wallet Generation:** Uses ECDSA to create a private/public key pair.
2. **Transaction Creation:** Transactions are signed with the sender's private key for security.
3. **Block Mining:** Pending transactions are added to a block. Mining involves finding a nonce such that the block hash starts with a set number of zeros (difficulty).
4. **Chain Validation:** Each block and transaction is verified for authenticity and integrity.

## Example Transaction

```python
# Generate wallets
alice_priv, alice_pub = generate_wallet()
bob_priv, bob_pub = generate_wallet()

# Create and sign transaction
tx = Transaction(alice_pub, bob_pub, 5)
tx.sign(alice_priv)

# Add transaction and mine block
blockchain.add_transaction(tx)
blockchain.mine_block(alice_pub)
```
